#Adding docker for agents
#1 Configure the target system docker for we/REST access
# add the following to the start or ExecStart patameter of
# /lib/systemd/system/docker.service
-H tcp://0.0.0.0:4243

# then restart the docker service
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart docker 

#2 Now we can configure jenkins to reach out the new
# docker worker. We will need a docker image to point to
# for the agent:
jenkins/jnlp-slave

# And then we can create a new porject/job and add a docker 
# resource to it
